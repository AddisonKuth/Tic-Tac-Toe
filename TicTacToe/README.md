For my project, I want to make a game. I have began programming a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Javascript. So far, I have coded a 3 by 3 grid with X's being the color red, and O's being the color green. Where the Javascript comes into play is when any of the squares are clicked, the first one clicked turns red (X) and when the next square is clicked, it turns green (O). The two colors alternate from red to green to red to green etc. in any combination the squares are clicked in. I was able to figure this out with both the help of  StackOverflow, Przemek's post on a color changing function which makes use of arrays, as well as spending time tweaking the code to make my project function as intended. I have also coded a button in HTML that reloads the page, therefore reseting the game to play again and again. I learned this from Grepper, Alberto Peripolli's post on HTML buttons. As I continue to work on this project, I am going try to figure out a way to get Javascript to recognize if three squares of the same color are in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. I plan to program a message that will display on the screen saying if red or green wins. I also want to spend some more time working in CSS to make sure the final product looks good as in it's current form, it lacks visual detail.
